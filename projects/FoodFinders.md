---
This is a project that I worked on for ICS 314. It was meant to be a webapp designed to help people find places to eat on campus. It utilized a PostGRES database that could allow vendors to input whatever information they want to, which would then be saved 
on the website for users to view, once they log in. There is also a map on the page to help users be able to navigate and find their restaurants. We also built a ton of help pages for people who needed help understanding how to maneuver the website. Finally, everything would be published on Vercel.

This project has us work with teams, and we would approach developing this through issue-based development. We divided the work amongst ourselves so that each person had one specific aspect of the project to work on - one partner handled PostGRES, another handled Vercel, and I handled designing the webpages. This was spread out across a few weeks, and we were tasked to check in across two different "milestones".
