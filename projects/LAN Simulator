summary: "A LAN simulator designed to emulate networks."
---
This was a project I worked on in my EE 367 Lab. It was a project where we were grouped up with other people, and we were tasked with providing upgrades to a LAN simulator. Some of these tasks involved adding a DNS system, support for network topologies, and implementing other useful features, such as switches, packets, and the ability to download. It was an extremely technical lab that involved a lot of reading, and we were also assigned teams to work with, providing us an opportunity to further our teamworking skills.

The point of this project was to gain more hands-on experience with networks, as well as learn how to work with teams. Because there was many tasks to do for this lab, we split the work amongst our teammates, which served as a way of helping keep us on track. The work was also extremely technical to do, so the instructions we were given also served as a way of explaining the concepts to us, which helped further emphasize the importance of self-research when approaching a topic. Finally, the lab served as a way of getting us more comfortable with the tools of the trade - VSCode, Python, and C were all used to further familiarize to us through doing this project.
