How working with bootstrap organizes our websites
</div>

At this point in time, I've now completed a week's worth of coding in HTML.  When building these websites in VSCode, we were tasked to use Bootstrap 5  for our websites. This was interesting to use, because bootstrap 5 is an incredibly useful framework that can be used in such a massive variety of ways, to the point where learning it can be rewarding in it of itself. However, because bootstrap is only a framework, it can require a ton of learning to be able to get the hang of. Luckily, through this past week, ample opportunity was provided to gain experience. And through this experience, we can explain what bootstrap does for us that raw HTML can't.
  
## Why bootstrap?
What makes bootstrap so useful to work with is that it almost entirely does wonders for the style of our pages. HTML is a pretty good language to build websites with, but it's limitations is that if you only use HTML and CSS, a website might look archaic, unless you're willing to put a lot of time into adding more lines to your code in order to make it. Bootstrap, by default, will help you out with color, spacing, and font, and it can also help you with designing menu bars and ways to navigate, all in much fewer lines. The tradeoff to this is that learning how to use bootstrap is arduous, but because it's arduous, it makes coding a website significantly easier to do once you finally get past the learning curve.
